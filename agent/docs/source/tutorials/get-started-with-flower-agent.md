# Chat in your terminal

Use Flower Chat to run AgentApps from your terminal. In this tutorial, you'll
sign in to SuperGrid, stream a response, switch federations and agents, and
continue an earlier conversation.

Prefer the browser? Start with [Chat in your browser](quickstart.md).

```{note}
This tutorial targets Flower 1.35.0. Flower Agent and `flwr chat` are
experimental and may change between releases.
```

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Python 3.11 or newer
- a Flower account with Flower Agent access
- a terminal that can open the browser-based login flow

You don't need to provide model credentials for a SuperGrid run.

## Check the Flower version

Use `uvx` to run the documented version in an isolated environment:

```console
$ uvx --from flwr==1.35.0 flwr --version
flwr, version 1.35.0
```

Running an explicit version keeps every command in this tutorial on the same
CLI. If the package isn't available, follow the package or installation
instructions for your Flower environment.

## Configure and log in to SuperGrid

Flower creates `~/.flwr/config.toml` the first time a CLI command needs it. The
default file includes this connection:

```toml
[superlink.supergrid]
address = "supergrid.flower.ai"
```

If you maintain a custom file, ensure that section exists. Then log in:

```console
$ uvx --from flwr==1.35.0 flwr login supergrid
```

Open the printed authentication link and complete sign-in. The CLI stores the
resulting account credentials for later SuperGrid commands.

## Start a chat

```console
$ uvx --from flwr==1.35.0 flwr chat
```

```{figure} ../_static/screenshots/flwr-chat.png
:alt: Flower Chat terminal interface with Flower Agent selected and an empty prompt.

Flower Chat shows the selected agent above the prompt.
```

Flower verifies your stored login before opening the full-screen interface. At
startup, it selects your `@account/personal` federation. At the `❯` prompt,
ask:

```text
Explain Flower Agent in one sentence.
```

The selected AgentApp starts a SuperGrid run. Its response, reasoning summary,
and supported tool activity can stream into the transcript. Completed
responses render as Markdown. When the run finishes, the prompt becomes
available again.

If the interface does not open, follow [Troubleshoot AgentApp
runs](../how-to-guides/troubleshoot-agent-runs.md) before changing your project
or account connectors.

## Continue the conversation

Ask a follow-up that depends on the previous response:

```text
Rewrite that explanation for a ten-year-old.
```

Flower keeps both runs in the same run series. The default Flower Agent replays
the stored messages, so it can use the earlier answer. Custom AgentApps need to
implement that behavior themselves; a run series doesn't automatically give
the model access to earlier messages.

## Select another agent

Type `@` at the start of an empty prompt. The completion menu lists agents
available in the active federation. Select one, add a request, and press
{kbd}`Enter`:

```text
@publisher/agent Describe what you can help me with.
```

Only a leading app spec selects an agent. After a successful selection, the
label above the prompt changes. Selecting a different agent starts a new run
series, so context from the previous agent is not mixed into the new one.

If no agent appears, verify the current federation and account entitlement in
[Use agents and
federations](../how-to-guides/use-agents-and-federations.md).

## Switch federations

Enter `/federation` to open the federation completion menu. Select a federation
visible to your account, or type its full name:

```text
/federation @account/federation-name
```

Flower clears the current transcript, selects the default Flower Agent, and
starts a new conversation in that federation. Agent completion then lists the
agents assigned to the new federation.

## Use chat commands

Type `/` to open the command menu:

- `/help` lists available commands
- `/new` makes the next message start a new run series
- `/federation` selects a federation and starts a new conversation there
- `/history` shows conversations from the active federation
- `/quit` leaves Flower Chat

After entering `/history`, use the arrow keys to select a conversation, press
{kbd}`Enter` to continue it, or press {kbd}`Esc` to close the list. Flower
restores its user and assistant messages in the transcript and sends the next
message in the selected run series.

You can also press {kbd}`Ctrl+C`:

- during a run, it requests the run to stop
- while viewing history, it closes the history list
- with a draft, it clears the prompt
- from an empty idle prompt, it exits

## What happened

Each submitted message started one `AgentApp` run. SuperGrid supplied:

- an `AgentSession` for model and connector calls
- a Flower `Context` containing run configuration and persistent series state
- the selected AgentApp, resolved from its app spec or FAB hash
- a federation in which the run and its series are stored

Read [Use agents and
federations](../how-to-guides/use-agents-and-federations.md) for the full mental
model.
