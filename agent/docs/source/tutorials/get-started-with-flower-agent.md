# Get started with Flower Agent

Welcome to Flower Agent!

In this tutorial, you'll launch your first agent on SuperGrid using Flower's
built-in AgentApp. You won't need to write any code or provide model
credentials. By the end, you'll have started an agent run, inspected its status,
and seen how the main Flower Agent pieces fit together.

```{note}
Flower Agent is experimental. Its APIs and runtime behavior may change between
releases.
```

## Prerequisites

You need:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/);
- a Flower SuperGrid account with access to Flower Agent; and
- a terminal where you can run the Flower CLI.

Let's get started! 🌼

## Run Flower with uvx

The `uvx` command runs Flower in an isolated environment, so you don't need to
create or activate a virtual environment. Check that the CLI is available:

```console
$ uvx flwr --version
```

`uvx` downloads Flower the first time you run it and reuses the cached
environment for later commands.

## Log in to SuperGrid

Now connect the Flower CLI to your SuperGrid account using the built-in
`supergrid` connection:

```console
$ uvx flwr login supergrid
```

Follow the authentication link shown by the command. The CLI stores the
resulting account credentials for later SuperGrid commands.

## Start the built-in AgentApp

Run `@flwragent/flwr-agent` and provide the initial prompt through
`agent.input`:

```console
$ uvx flwr run @flwragent/flwr-agent supergrid \
    --run-config 'agent.input="Explain Flower Agent in one sentence."'
```

The CLI prints the run ID after SuperGrid accepts the run. The built-in AgentApp
sends your prompt to its configured model and records the response as agent
activity for the run.

Open the run in the SuperGrid dashboard to see the response and follow its
activity. You can also check its status from the terminal:

```console
$ uvx flwr list --run-id <run-id> supergrid
```

To stream the process logs while starting another run, add `--stream`:

```console
$ uvx flwr run @flwragent/flwr-agent supergrid \
    --run-config 'agent.input="Give me three uses for Flower Agent."' \
    --stream
```

Process logs help diagnose app startup and failures. The structured model and
connector activity remains available on the run page in SuperGrid.

## What happened

The command started a Flower App Bundle containing an `AgentApp`, and
SuperGrid:

1. resolved the built-in app;
1. combined its default configuration with your `agent.input` override;
1. created an AgentApp task;
1. supplied the task with an `AgentSession` and a Flower `Context`; and
1. ran the app and persisted its result.

The `AgentSession` is the app's interface to runtime-provided model and
connector capabilities. The `Context` contains the run configuration and
persistent run state.

## Final remarks

Congratulations, you've run your first Flower Agent on SuperGrid! 🎉

You ran Flower with `uvx`, authenticated with SuperGrid, started the built-in
AgentApp with your own prompt, and inspected the resulting run. The same runtime
will also run AgentApps you write yourself. You only need to provide the agent
logic and project configuration.

## Next steps

- [Write your first AgentApp](write-your-first-agentapp.md) to create a custom
  Flower Agent project.
- [Run an AgentApp on
  SuperGrid](../how-to-guides/run-on-supergrid.md) to learn how to configure,
  observe, and stop a run.
- [Run an AgentApp with a local
  SuperLink](../how-to-guides/run-with-local-superlink.md) for local
  development.
